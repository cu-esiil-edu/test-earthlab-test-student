This is a repository for the [PhenoCam](https://phenocam.nau.edu/webcam/) workshop presented at the [2024 Macrosystems Ecology For All (MEFA) meeting](https://erenweb.org/mefa-events/2024-annual-meeting/) held in Boulder, CO in July 2024. Material includes instructions about how to access PhenoCam data and imagery directly from the website (via API), and how to create greenness timeseries plots, as well as a photo layout and gif showing seasonal changes in a PhenoCam site over the course of a year.

Instructions about how to use this code can be found on the [ESIIL Learning Portal](https://cu-esiil-edu.github.io/esiil-learning-portal/mefa/notebooks/07-phenocam/phenocam.html).
